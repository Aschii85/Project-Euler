When compiling FORTRAN code with external modules (from another file), sepcify the file that the module is in at compile time!

For example:

"gfortran mod/num_theory.f90 p046.f90"

This will run the program in p046.f90 and link (I think it is called) it to the module num_theory that it is using in mod/num_theory.f90.

The output file is the standard one unless specified.
